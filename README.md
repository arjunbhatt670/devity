### Deploy to production

During the build process, database migrations are automatically executed, so there's no need to run them manually. However, you must define `DATABASE_URL` in your environment variables.

Then, you can generate a production build with:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

It generates an optimized production build. To test the generated build, run:

```shell
$ npm run start
```

You also need to defined the environment variables `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` using your own key.

This command starts a local server using the production build. You can now open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser to see the result.
